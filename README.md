Hey there 👋 Welcome to our public GitHub!

This is our little corner of the internet where we share some of the stuff we’re working on — open-source tools, examples, random experiments, and things we think might be useful to others.
We don’t post everything here though — most of the detailed docs, deep dives, and guides live on our main documentation site.

So if you’re looking for the full picture — check it out [Hightower Documentaion](https://chains.htw.tech/docs)! You’ll find way more info there, including how things work under the hood, setup instructions, and updates.

We’ll keep adding new things here over time, so feel free to watch the repo or drop us a star ⭐ if you like what we’re doing.
